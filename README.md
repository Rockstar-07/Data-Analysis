# Libraries required for Data Analysis

# 1. Numpy : Numerical Python
**Numpy is a python library used for working with arrays. It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
Array is the collection of similar type of elements
import numpy as np**

# 2. Pandas : Pandas is a data analysis tool kit which can handle different kinds of data, also handles missing data.

# 3. Matplotlib : Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK+.

# 4. Seaborn : Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
